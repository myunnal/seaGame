# The Jelli Project

1.	Game genre and target audience  
Relaxing, mission-based Action Game.  
Made for casual player who like exploration and low-stress action.  
2.	Synopsis – describing the story idea (in one sentence):  
The ocean is slowly suffocating under plastic waste and you are a small jellyfish whose mucus can dissolve pollution and help life return to normal.  
3.	Narrative Script (one paragraph):  
The ocean was once full of life, colorful corals and happy fish, but plastic waste has drained  it of its life so much, that you can barely call it your home. Gladly you – just a small jellyfish, have the power to use your mucus to dissolve the plastic and free the trapped creatures. With every piece of plastic destroyed, the ocean begins to heal, its colors return and every underwater critter can finally breathe again.  
4.	Narrative with the different phases (EA3), moments, and challenges (according to the Monomyth model):  
Ordinary World  
The jellyfish drifts through a musty, polluted ocean filled with lifeless debris and plants  
Call to Adventure  
You accidentally dissolve a piece of plastic, finding out that you can use this power to help others.  
Limitation

Crossing the Threshold  
You leave the safe starting area and enter deeper, more polluted zones.  
Trials and Challenges  
Heavier trash, stronger currents, human made obsticles and rescue missions test stamina management and precision.

7.	Game mechanics  
7.1.	Core Gameplay  
The player controls the jellyfish and can move freely. The jellyfish can stop moving to recover stamina and plan actions.  
7.2.	Controls  
Movement:  
A button – move to the left;  
D button – move to the right;  
W button – move forwards;  
Shift – move down;  
Space – move up;  
Basic attack:  
Clicking the left mouse button shoots out mucus and consumes a small amount of stamina.  
Charged attack:  
Hold left mouse button to shoot out a bigger clump of mucus. This action consumes a large amount of stamina but deals more damage. Slows the player when charging.  
7.3.	Mucus stamina system  
The jellyfish has a mucus stamina bar, which limits how often it can attack. Attacking consumes mucus and when the bar is empty the jellyfish cannot attack.  
The jellyfish can regenerate mucus by remaining still, saving other animals. Entering  restored ocean areas makes the jellyfish restore stamina faster.  
7.4.	Trash destruction system  
Trash vary by durability:  
Small trash  requires one hit to be destroyed;  
Medium trash requires 5 hits, or one charged attack;  
Big trash requires 20 hits, 3 charged attacks;  
Larger trash can block paths, so the player has to plan their stamina consumption.  
7.5.	Ocean health meter
Each level has an ocean health meter, that increases as trash is destroyed and animals are saved. Ocean health affects clarity, mucus regeneration speed, background music
7.6.	Rescue missions
The jellyfish can free animals trapped in trash. Completing these missions  increases ocean health significantly and refills the mucus stamina bar.
